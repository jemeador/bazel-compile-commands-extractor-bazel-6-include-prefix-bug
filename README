Dependencies that use `include_prefix` cause fragile compile_commands.json to
be generated. Simply generating the new compile_commands.json deletes files
symlinked in the bazel-out folder.

`includes` is not a suitable option for in-worksapce code because it causes
serious compile warnings to be ignored completely.

To try different versions, change .bazelversion and rerun ./reproduce_problem.sh.

.bazelversion==5.4.1 output:
````
OK
````

.bazelversion==6.0.0 output:
````
'bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/lib/_virtual_includes/math/math.h' is a broken symlink
````

Opening an editor with clangd support will demonstrate that the `my_add` symbol
cannot be found in `main.cpp`.
